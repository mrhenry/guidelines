# Javascript

✓ — Always end statements with a colon

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

✓ — Always declare your variables with the `var` statement.

```js
var my_nice_and_descriptive_variable = "Hello World";
```

✓ — When working on a Mr. Henry project, ALWAYS use Hanging Gardens to manage your javascript dependencies.

✗ — Never use global variables. ALWAYS use the `var` statement! (Or, I, @fd, will make you suffer.)

✗ — Never include micro-jQuery-plugins. If you can write it in 20 LOC, write it your self.


## Conditions

✗ — ``if ( !(typeof foo === "undefined" ) )``

✓ — ``if ( foo !== undefined )``
